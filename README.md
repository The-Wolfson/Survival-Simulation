## Usage

To run the simulation, use the following command:
```sh
swift run <gridSize> <numberOfPieces> <noOfFrames> <noOfTeams>
```
- `<gridSize>`: Int - The size of the grid for the simulation.
- `<numberOfPieces>`: Int - The number of objects per team.
- `<noOfFrames>`: Int - The number of frames to be simulated.
- `<noOfTeams>`: Int - The number of teams in the simulation (must be an odd number and less than 9).
